        </h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>Living species represent a really small proportion of all species that have ever lived.
          Ignoring fossil taxa may lead to simplification or misinterpretation of macroevolutionary patterns and processes such as species richness through time, paleobiogeography or ecological diversity:
        </p>
        <DL>
          <DD>-For example, the Probosidea family (elephants and relatives) are represented by only 2 extant genera but that number rises to 43 when the extinct genera are included.</p>
          <DD>-Tinamous, which are South-American flying birds are the only members of their group (Tinamiformes) but their closest fossil relatives are the giant flightless Moas found in New-Zealand on the other side of the Pacific Ocean.</p>
          <DD>-Crocodilomorphs (crocodiles, alligators and gavials) live in either fluvial or coastal habitats today, but the fossil record also contains many pelagic, fully terrestrial or even semi-arboreal species.</p>
        </DL>
        <p>Therefore it is critically important to add fossils into phylogenies to understand the full macroevolutionary processes that led to present day biodiversity.
          I am interested in the practicalities of methods for building phylogenies with living and fossil taxa as well as the new approaches for analysing them using state-of-the art of comparative methods.
          During my PhD I am investigating the effect of adding fossil taxa to phylogenetic inference and to phylogenetic comparative methods.

        </h3>
        <p>Traditionally, neontologists use fossils as nodes for calibrating molecular clocks and paleontologists, on the other hand, use fossils as tips but through a maximum parsimony approach. 
          However, one class of methods, called Total Evidence Methods, allows to infer phylogenies by combining both living and fossil morphological data with living taxa molecular data.
          This method has several clear advantages such as the ability to infer the tree from the supermatrix using probabilistic methods (i.e. Maximum Likelihood or Bayesian) or using the fossils as tips rather than nodes.
        <p>Although these methods for combining living and fossil taxa in the same trees seem very promising, they require a lot of data and are therefore likely to suffer from missing data issues, which may affect their ability to infer correct phylogenies.
          Through a simulation approach, I am testing what is the actual effect of missing data on recovering accurate tree topology.
          I found that...

        </h3>
        <p>One advantage of trees containing fossils as tips rather than nodes is that one can apply phylogenetic comparative methods on both fossil and living species and therefore more accurately infer the evolution of a clade along the phylogeny.
          Also, by the way they are build, these phylogenetic trees allows to have a large quantity of cladistic (morphological) data available for studying the evolution of a trait within the clade through time.
          One way to summarize the cladistic data of a group of taxa is to analyse the variance/co-variance of these traits summarized in a morphospace showing the cladistic space that the various taxa are occupying. 
        </p>
        <p>I am interested in the ways to detect and quantify any relative or absolute changes in cladistic morphospace through time.</p>

        </h3>
        <p>Using phylogenies for looking at the tempo and mode of evolution of some traits or at their evolutionary correlation is one of the major class of phylogenetic comparative methods.
          Because of the popularity of such analysis, I'm interested in looking at the effect of fossils in phylogenies on the estimation of the fit of traits evolutionary models and strengh or direction of correlation between them.
